<li>

<p>
What kind of study is it, e.g., descriptive, correlational?
</p>

<p>
This is an experimental study.
</p>

</li>

<li>

<p>
What are the independent variables? How are you operationalizing them?
</p>

<p>
The independent variable was the level of uncertainty introduced in the task. This included income uncertainty (either receiving a consistent $500 or ranging between $250-750) and goal uncertainty (either knowing the goal was $6000 or ranging between $4000-8000).</p>

</li>

<li>
<p>
What are the dependent variables that were measured? How are you operationalizing them?
</p>

<p>
The main DV in this experiment was saving rates across the experiment - that is, the average amount you saved at different stages of the experiment. Additionally, we will be measuring the number of participants who successfully achieve the savings goal.
</p>

</li>

<li>
<p>
What is one potential confounding variable and how have you attempted to control for it?
</p>

<p>
One potential confounding variable is that participants would be overloaded by too much information and not pay enough attention to the savings goal reward amount. To address this, we included an instruction summary and a reminder summary.
</p>

</li>

<li>
<p>
What is one potential ethical issue, and how has the experimenter attempted to resolve it?
</p>

<p>
Financial reward might have been an inducement to sign up for the study so we did not mention the possibility of financial reward until after participants had indicated their interest in participating.
</p>

</li>

<li>
<p>
How did the experimenter get from first year psychology to conducting this research?
</p>

<p>
During my undergraduate degree, I was interested in cognitive psychology and decided to focus on it for my Honours project. This experiment is a continuation of my research as part of my PhD.
