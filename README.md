# Demo of integrating Sona with a jsPsych/JATOS setup

This shows a way of allowing auto-crediting of Sona participants when using an experiment running on [JATOS](https://www.jatos.org/).
It also shows a way of delivering an information/consent form and debrief when using  [jsPsych](https://www.jspsych.org) to code the experiment.
